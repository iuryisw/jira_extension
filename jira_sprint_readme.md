## Installation

### Step 1: Download the Files

Create a new folder on your computer (e.g., `JiraSprintExtension`) and save these files:

1. `manifest.json` - Extension configuration
2. `content.js` - Main logic
3. `styles.css` - Styling
4. Create placeholder icon files (or use your own):
   - `icon16.png` (16x16 pixels)
   - `icon48.png` (48x48 pixels)
   - `icon128.png` (128x128 pixels)

### Step 2: Create Icons (Optional)

You can create simple icon images or use any sprint/JIRA-related icon. If you don't have icons, you can create simple colored squares as placeholders:

- Open Paint or any image editor
- Create images with the sizes mentioned above
- Save them with the correct names

### Step 3: Load Extension in Edge

1. Open Microsoft Edge
2. Navigate to `edge://extensions/`
3. Enable **Developer mode** (toggle in the bottom-left corner)
4. Click **Load unpacked**
5. Select the folder containing your extension files
6. The extension should now be loaded and active

### Step 4: Test It

1. Go to your JIRA board (e.g., `https://yourcompany.atlassian.net/jira/software/...`)
2. The sprint details should automatically appear near the quick filters
3. If it doesn't appear immediately, refresh the page

## Troubleshooting

### Extension not working?

1. **Check the console**: Right-click on the page ‚Üí Inspect ‚Üí Console tab
   - Look for messages starting with "JIRA Sprint Extension:"
   
2. **Verify permissions**: Make sure the extension has permission to access your JIRA domain
   - Go to `edge://extensions/`
   - Click on the extension
   - Check "Site permissions"

3. **Try refreshing**: Sometimes JIRA's dynamic loading requires a page refresh

### Sprint details not appearing?

- Check that the sprint details button exists in JIRA (look for the circular arrow icon)
- The extension needs to click the sprint details button to extract information
